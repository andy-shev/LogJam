	The visible metas when you hit "new" should only be the ones you
	explicitly turned on; if you edit an old entry (which shows the date),
	then hit "new", you shouldn't be stuck with the date showing.
	This is how it was supposed to work in the first place.
	* menu.c: Remove some hacks.
	* jamview.h:  Add _emit_conf function to allow menu to sync with view
	  even when view is created first.
	* jamview.c:  Make _load_conf reset all the metas to the

	* po/de.po:  Updated.

Sat, 07 Feb 2004 11:47:24 +0200  Gaal Yahas  <gaal@forum2.org>

	Bring back checkfriends feature. Whether to check friends is
	now a per-account setting with a master on/off switch.

Thu,  5 Feb 2004 10:22:06 -0800  Evan Martin  <martine@danga.com>

	http://www.livejournal.com/community/logjam/
	  73089.html?thread=462721#t462721

Wed,  4 Feb 2004 17:37:04 -0800  Evan Martin  <martine@danga.com>

	Reported by Kir Kolyshkin:
	* friendgroups.c:  Localize strings.

	* jam_xml.c:  Wrong function.
	* conf.h, music.[ch], spawn.[ch]:  New generic interface for lists of
	  commands.

	  right yet: if rb isn't running, everything breaks.
	* conf_xml.c:  Conf loading now much simpler.
	* init.c:  Use new interface.
	* settings.c:  Use new interface for music and web browser; merge
	  the two under "Programs" on the "System" tab.

	* src/jamview.c: bring back music detection

Fri, 30 Jan 2004 01:01:00 -0800  Evan Martin  <martine@danga.com>

	* jam.c:  More horizontal space in the bottom bar.  Use stock button
	  for submit / save.
	* jam.h:  Kill a few unused fields.
	* icons.c:  Register a stock id for the submit button.
	  Now we need an icon.  :)
	* userlabel.c:  "using", not "posting in": you can do stuff other than

Fri, 30 Jan 2004 00:40:04 -0800  Evan Martin  <martine@danga.com>

	* datesel.c:  Properly remove timeout when destroyed.
	* jamdoc.c:  Emit a "usejournal changed" notification.  Make the
	  "account changed" notification use the GTK notification system.
	* jam.c, jamview.c, menu.c:  Use new signals instead of calling into
	  each other.  Much cleaner!

Thu, 29 Jan 2004 23:51:18 -0800  Evan Martin  <martine@danga.com>

	* all around:  ifdef out all the Blogger bits.  We're putting it off
	  for this release.

	* jam.c:  When they click "save", don't run "delete".  :(

Tue, 13 Jan 2004 18:50:02 -0800  Evan Martin  <martine@danga.com>

	* network-fork.c, network-libxml.c:  Pull out forking code from
	  curl code and generalize to work with libxml too.

Sun, 11 Jan 2004 12:06:59 -0800  Evan Martin  <martine@danga.com>

	Bring back checkfriends.

	* checkfriends.c:  Use signals instead of an explicit child list.
	* checkfriends-gtk.c:  Kill generic "cfindicator" idea; the different

	* images/, icons.c, network-throbber:  Use fancy throbber instead of
	  cfriends icons to indicate new entries.
	* init.c, menu.c, jam:  Use new functions.

	* images/Makefile.am:  Store large images RLE-encoded.
	* icons.c:  Undo Windows hack (RLE-encoded image data should be small

	* network*:  Remove net_request_rub/net_verb_run. (!!!)

	  run anyway.

Thu,  8 Jan 2004 10:38:41 -0800  Evan Martin  <martine@danga.com>

	* Makefile.am, network.h, network-ctx.[ch]: Network "contexts".
	* account.h, host.c, blogger.c, livejournal.c:  Use NetContexts
	  instead of GtkWindows.
	* cmdline.c:  Use commadline-provided password.  Use NetContexts.
	* jam.c, friends.c, login.c:  Run NetContexts instead of LJVerbs.
	* network-curl.c, jamview.c:  Small warning fix.
	* network-gtk.c:  Implement NetContextGtk, add titles to windows,
	  hide progress bar until it's useful.
	* sync.c:  Use window titles.

Mon, 05 Jan 2004 21:09:06 -0800  Evan Martin  <martine@danga.com>

	* cmdline.[ch], init.c:  Load cmdline into a doc directly
	  and move Cmdline structures into cmdline.c, cutting out a huge pile
	  of code.
	* cmdline.c:  Resurrect the "post immediately" command.
	* jamdoc.h: Minor cleanups.
	* jamdoc.c, init.c, jam.[ch]:  Make doc start without an account,
	  and make others use doc's account.
	* cmdline.c, opts.yml:  Add --file option back in.

	  to run commandline console commands.
	* menu.c: Use newly-fixed up console.h.
	* cmdline.c:  Use liblivejournal's LJConsoleCommand to run
	  commandline-based console commands.  (Effect: we no longer
	  pop up windows when commandline-based console commands fail.)

Sun, 04 Jan 2004 10:59:17 -0800  Evan Martin  <martine@danga.com>

	* network, network-internal.h, network-curl.c:  Put errors
	  into a NET_ERROR domain, and add a new NET_ERROR_PROTOCOL
	  level of errors.  This way, we can detect whether our
	  challenge request failed totally (network down?) or just
	  at the protocol level (server doesn't support challenges)
	  and adjust accordingly (a subsequent request in the first
	  case will fail in the same way...).

Sun, 04 Jan 2004 01:08:33 -0800  Evan Martin  <martine@danga.com>

	* console.c:  Use liblivejournal's "consolecommand" verb.

	  main account.

Sat, 03 Jan 2004 23:58:25 -0800  Evan Martin  <martine@danga.com>

	* network.c:  If the server supports the c0 auth type (or
	  we don't know what it supports), try challenge-response
	  login.  Yay no more replayable passwords!  (But we're not fully
	  there yet: need to eliminate all calls to net_request_new()).

Sat, 03 Jan 2004 14:21:34 -0800  Evan Martin  <martine@danga.com>

	* cmdline.c, gen.pl:  Add --list-subcommands switch to all
	  commands with subcommands, in the hopes that it will
	  simplify tab completion.  (Also, merging the subcommand
	  strings in separately makes it easier to translate.)
	  
Thu, 01 Jan 2004 15:20:28 -0800  Evan Martin  <martine@danga.com>

	* init.c, cmdline.[ch], gen.pl:  Move cmdline.h to cmdline_data.h,
	  move commandline parsing out of init.c and into cmdline.[ch].

Thu, 01 Jan 2004 13:40:26 -0800  Evan Martin  <martine@danga.com>

	* init.c, configure.ac:  Grep cleanups, autoconf support for
	  conditionally using regex.h.

Tue, 30 Dec 2003 17:04:59 -0800  Evan Martin  <martine@danga.com>
	
	Win32 fixes.
	* build/win32/*:  lotsa changes to paths.
	* icons.c:  Gross hack because the blogger image overwhelms
	  the compiler.
	* init.c:  Conditionally use regex.h.
	* journalstore.c:  Pull in winsock for htonl.  Signedness fixes.
	* livejournal.c, blogger.c:  Function taking no arguments is
	  (void), not ().
	* network-win32.c:  Update to new internal API.  FIXME: doesn't
	  pass along headers yet.

Tue, 30 Dec 2003 19:03:43 -0800  Evan Martin  <martine@danga.com>

	* init.c:  Rearrange to make logjam -h fit within 25 lines.
	* init.c:  Nuke "save user"/"save password" options.  They were
	  never implemented and were confusing anyway.
	* init.c:  Console arg-parsing bugfix.
	* gen/opts.yml, init.c:  Make all offline commands a subcommand of
	  "offline".

Tue, 30 Dec 2003 00:07:52 -0800  Evan Martin  <martine@danga.com>

	* init.c:  Minor changes to use new liblivejournal API.

Mon, 29 Dec 2003 23:13:33 -0800  Evan Martin  <martine@danga.com>

	* util/xmmsclient/Makefile.am:  Remove redundant CFLAGS.

Mon, 29 Dec 2003 23:05:34 -0800  Evan Martin  <martine@danga.com>

	* preview.c:  Show protected/private icons in preview.

Fri, 26 Dec 2003 15:55:21 -0800  Evan Martin  <martine@danga.com>

	* journalstore.c:  Split version information into index and
	  xml version information.

Fri, 26 Dec 2003 15:50:35 -0800  Evan Martin  <martine@danga.com>

	* init.c, opts.yml, gen.pl:  Allow -h/--help for all commands.
	  Pull shared getopt-style parsing into a hairy macro.
	  Clean up help.

Wed, 24 Dec 2003 12:28:34 -0800  Evan Martin  <martine@danga.com>

	* friends.c:  If you add yourself, it's a two-way connection.
	  If you remove yourself, the two-way connection is gone.

Wed, 24 Dec 2003 12:07:19 -0800  Evan Martin  <martine@danga.com>

	* security, jamview.c:  Bring back custom security.

Wed, 24 Dec 2003 11:45:49 -0800  Evan Martin  <martine@danga.com>

	* journalstore.c:  Make get_count return the actual entry count,
	  which is what some code was assuming and other code wasn't.
	* index.c:  Use right function.

Tue, 23 Dec 2003 20:56:46 -0800  Evan Martin  <martine@danga.com>

	* journalstore.c:  Store index in network byte order.
	  Swap endianness around if we find an old index with the wrong order.

Sun, 21 Dec 2003 12:19:30 -0800  Evan Martin  <martine@danga.com>

	* journalstore.c:  Break out of search if we have more than
	  a thousand matches.  (Really, we need to search in a separate
	  process and report results.  This is a quick fix to prevent
	  the UI from blocking too long.)

Sun, 21 Dec 2003 11:36:58 -0800  Evan Martin  <martine@danga.com>

	(Forgot to update the changelog for the last few commits.)
	* userlabel, jam.c:  Show "current user" label and include host. 

Wed, 10 Dec 2003 22:23:54 -0800  Evan Martin  <martine@danga.com>

	* everything:  Massive reorganization of structure.  Yay.
	* jamview.c:  Don't store empty subject (cascaded effect:
	  HTML preview doesn't show horizontal line when no subject).

Tue,  9 Dec 2003 14:15:21 -0800  Evan Martin  <martine@danga.com>

	* menu.c:  C99 fix.
	* link.c, login.c:  Handle Blogger properly.
	* account, host.c, blogger.c, livejournal.c:  Allow
	  deleting entries (LJ only so far).

Tue, 09 Dec 2003 21:45:43 +0200  Gaal Yahas  <gaal@forum2.org>

	* gen/opts.yml, console.c, init.c: CLI console
	* console.h: added file.

Mon, 08 Dec 2003 22:47:14 +0200  Gaal Yahas  <gaal@forum2.org>

	* init.c: cleanup
	* jam.c, jamview.c settings.c: fix spellcheck

Sun, 07 Dec 2003 21:35:30 +0200  Gaal Yahas  <gaal@forum2.org>

	New command line autogeneration system: we now use YAML
	<http://yaml.org/> to hold all information about command line
	arguments (including help); the code can nest arbitrarily deep
	subcommands.

	* gen/gen.pl, gen/cmdline.h.tmpl, gen/opts.yml: new files
	* gen/gen.pl, gen/cmdlineopts.h.tmpl, gen/helptext.h.tmpl, 
	  gen/opts.dat: removed files
	* gen/regen.sh, gen/logjam.tmpl-doc.pl, src/init.c: changed to
	  new system

Sun, 07 Dec 2003 11:03:26 -0800  Evan Martin  <martine@danga.com>

	* po:  Include logjam.desktop in translations.
	* jamview.c, jamdoc:  Make comments and preformatted options work.
	* jamview.c:  Hiding a meta widget resets its value.
	* init.c:  Make "cat -m" output work as a real mbox mailbox.
	* manager.c, blogger:  Allow users to add blogger hosts.
	* menu.c:  Disable View and Journal menus when using a Blogger account.
	* all over:  Tracking down doc signals to prevent multiple emissions.
	  Associated rearrangement of code (migrate jam.c stuff to jamview.c).
	  Still not there yet.  (Eliminated title_changed signal on docs.)
	* configure.ac, Makefile.am:  Cleanups.  Don't include debug flags as
	  defaults (use "./configure CFLAGS='-Wall -g'" when debugging).
	* offline.c:  Show a lame text preview when we don't have HTML widgets.

Thu, 04 Dec 2003 21:37:17 -0800  Evan Martin  <martine@danga.com>

	* blogger/Makefile.am: pull gxr into build.
	* gen/opts.dat: Add reindex, grep, and cat to command-line help.
	* init.c: Clean up cat.
	* offline.c: Autosize subject-column width in entry browser.
	* init.c, sync.[ch]:  "summary" command summarizes export status.
	* checkfriends.c:  Make cli-based checkfriends work again.
	* configure.ac, logjam.desktop.in:  Make desktop entry (show up
	  in GNOME/KDE/etc menu).  We now depend on intltool.
	* conf.h, settings.c, checkfriends.c:  Make dock icon independent
	  of checkfriends, and make it show/hide the main window.
	* history_recent.c: Include date column (when did that break?!).
	* jamview.c:  Load metas when we load a document.
	* jamview.c, jam.c:  Rearrange undo handling; much simpler now.
	* jamview.c:  Be sure to load security in case widget is showing,
	  even if the doc is public.
	* friends.c:  You should still be able to bring up friends window even
	  when you have no friends (why did nobody report this?).
	* offline.c:  Summarize number of matches when searching offline.

Thu, 04 Dec 2003 12:00:00 -0800  Evan Martin  <martine@danga.com>

	* Today sometime around noon I committed my devel branch.
	  So much changed, and I didn't document any of it.  :\

Wed, 08 Oct 2003 18:14:59 -0700  Evan Martin  <martine@danga.com>

	* build/:  More win32 changes (put dll and executable in
	  toplevel directory).
	* src/:  More win32 fixes (better casts, and disable threaded
	  network requests until I can figure out glib bug).

Tue, 07 Oct 2003 20:24:45 -0700  Evan Martin  <martine@danga.com>
	
	* build/*:  Add Visual Studio projects to the build.
	  I'm considering moving the autogen/autoconf/etc. files 
	  into that subdir, but I suspect that would break stuff.
	* all over:  Win32 fixes.

Thu, 18 Sep 2003 21:29:02 -0700  Evan Martin  <martine@danga.com>

	HTML tags.  (<lj user="k001">, <lj user="bacek">.)
	* Makefile.am, html_markup.[ch]: Code to insert/wrap selection
	  in HTML tags.
	* menu.c:  Menu items.
	In the future, I'd like hitting the hotkey a second time to cancel
	out the tag.  But putting this in now will make me get there faster.

Thu, 18 Sep 2003 20:41:36 -0700  Evan Martin  <martine@danga.com>

	* init.c:  Bring back remote commands (running LogJam twice should
	  pop up one window: 
	  http://www.livejournal.com/community/logjam_dev/8397.html).

Thu, 18 Sep 2003 20:30:05 -0700  Evan Martin  <martine@danga.com>

	* userlabel.[ch], jam.c:  Look like lj user tags to indicate current
	  user.  I'm not sure if I like it.
	* init.c:  Bring back user editor.
	* network.h, sync.c:  Finish sync progress, including GTK.  It seems
	  to work?  LiveJournal.com is too slow for me to be able to test on a
	  "real" dataset.

Sun, 14 Sep 2003 16:50:50 -0700  Evan Martin  <martine@danga.com>

	Over the summer, LogJam development was primarily hosted in a
	Subversion repository.  Development moved rapidly and I didn't
	record any ChangeLogs.  We're now moving back to CVS, so I will
	again try to keep up the ChangeLog.

	Major differences from the released version:
	 - new "liblivejournal" forces API cleanliness;
	 - CVS-style command line interface;
	 - sync code rewritten and is much faster (that was a bug) and
	   cleaner (that part isn't complete yet).

Fri, 22 Aug 2003 13:45:06 +0300  Gaal Yahas  <gaal@forum2.org>
	
	* src/init.c: CLI 'grep' command; 'latest' argument for cat
	* src/journalstore.[ch]: 'latest' support

Thu, 21 Aug 2003 22:51:53 +0300  Gaal Yahas  <gaal@forum2.org>

	More on CLI: 'cat'.
	* src/init.c: CLI 'cat' command
	* liblivejournal/entry.[ch]: lj_entry_to_rfc822 [string]
	* gen/gen/cmdlineopts.h.tmpl: prepend '+' to short getopt

	TODO:
	- gen(.pl)eralize command options, arbitrarily deep.
	- xml cat	

Wed, 20 Aug 2003 09:10:33 +0300  Gaal Yahas  <gaal@forum2.org>

	* checkfriends.c: fix checkfriends with mask

Fri, 18 Jul 2003 07:13:14 -0700  Gaal Yahas  <gaal@forum2.org>

	* logjam.dsp, Makefile.msc, init.c:  Leftover Windows fixes.

Tue, 15 Jul 2003 14:25:36 +0300  Gaal Yahas  <gaal@forum2.org>

	Generalizations in code to prepare for multiple logins and
	multiple documents. Weaken couplings of nearly everything
	to conf_cur_user() and conf_cur_server().
	* account.[ch]: JamAccount type
	* jamview.[ch]: JamView type
	* `grep 'JamAccount\|JamView' *[ch]`: refactor to use new types
	This patch temporarily breaks usejournal ("post as"). This will
	be fixed soon.

	Most files: facilitate precompiling headers for when gcc uses them

	All files: Great Renaming. The application now uses the Jam prefix
	for its types and functions.

	* logjam.dsp: MSDEV project file on Win32 (ijon)
	* init.c: getpass for win32 (gaal, following note from ijon)


Mon, 14 Jul 2003 07:58:40 -0700  Evan Martin  <martine@danga.com>

	Primarily:  usejournal logic is now in menu.  Hopefully, this
	will make Gaal's job (multiple logins) easier.
	* conf_xml.c:  Better error reporting.
	* livejournal-entry.c:  Simpler (pseudo-)RFC822 parser.
	* lj.[ch], usejournal.[ch], menu.[ch]:  Usability test
	  (watching Whitaker use LogJam) shows that usejournal should
	  be in the menu.
	* manager.c:  Default size wider.
	* util.c:  More efficient recursive mkdir.

Wed, 09 Jul 2003 18:44:58 -0700  Evan Martin  <martine@danga.com>

	* manager.c:  Make string more amenable to translations.
	* preview.c:  Set a default size.
	* TODO:  Updates!
	* po/POTFILES.in:  Update for new files.

Wed, 09 Jul 2003 19:59:01 +0300  Gaal Yahas  <gaal@forum2.org>

	* spawn.c: use single quotes on urls; add browser to list

Wed, 09 Jul 2003 17:41:14 -0700  Evan Martin  <martine@danga.com>

	* logjam-xmms-client.c:  Properly default to XMMS session 0.

Wed, 09 Jul 2003 17:33:33 -0700  Evan Martin  <martine@danga.com>

	* livejournal-types.c:  Wrong function.
	* login.c:  Rearrangement to improve look and code style.

Mon, 07 Jul 2003 19:43:43 -0700  Evan Martin  <martine@danga.com>

	* many files:  Require the user to choose a user to run as, and only
	  login when they pick "update information".
	* login.c, livejournal.h, livejournal-types.c, menu.c:
	  Web menus now load into an intermediate structure.
	* login.[ch], lj.c:  Because of above, login no longer needs to
	  interact with LJWins directly.
	* conf_xml.c:  Load/save webmenus.
	* lj.c:  Spelling fixes; when submitting a draft, offer to delete the
	  local copy.

Sat, 05 Jul 2003 20:34:09 +0300  Gaal Yahas  <gaal@forum2.org>

	* init.c, livejournal-entry.c: bring back -e (edit entry with
	  user editor)

Mon, 30 Jun 2003 22:16:42 -0700  Evan Martin  <martine@cs.washington.edu>

	* livejournal-entry.c:  Properly load comments type from XML.

Fri, 27 Jun 2003 15:23:51 -0700  Evan Martin  <martine@cs.washington.edu>

	* network-throbber.c:  Properly init SVG throbber (less flicker).
	* network-gtk.c:  After reverting a previous reversion and changing
	  it a bit beyond that, the window is now a proper dialog, but it
	  still behaves like an OS X sheet on nice window managers while not
	  killing weird ones like ion.

Thu, 26 Jun 2003 14:02:04 -0700  Evan Martin  <martine@cs.washington.edu>

	* checkfriends.c:  Wrong function.  (Gaal)
	* journalstore.c:  Set version when creating index, otherwise
	  index will never load! (John Patterson <john@ninecats.org>).
	* conf_xml.c, livejournal.h, login.c, manager.c, network-curl.c:
	  Remove "fast server" option, as it's no longer supported.

Thu, 26 Jun 2003 01:14:06 -0700  Evan Martin  <martine@cs.washington.edu>

	* conf_xml.c:  Remove extra g_print.
	* preview.c:  Don't show date when entry hasn't been dated yet;
	  don't add line at the top unless the entry has a date or subject.
	* init.c:  We have to let GTK look at the command line before we
	  look at it, so we don't error out on GTK command-line options.
	  Also, better control flow.

Wed, 25 Jun 2003 22:20:41 -0700  Evan Martin  <martine@cs.washington.edu>

	* images/inline-images.rb:  Generate C header of raw image data.
	* images/inline.h:  Generated file.
	* images/Makefile.am:  Don't install lj user icons; include inline.h.
	* src/preview.c:  Use inlined images instead of external files.

Wed, 25 Jun 2003 19:05:44 -0700  Evan Martin  <martine@cs.washington.edu>

	* history_recent.c:  Fix crash.
	* preview.c:  Show more information in preview.
	* util.c:  Remove unnecessary cast.

Wed, 25 Jun 2003 18:57:33 -0700  Evan Martin  <martine@cs.washington.edu>
	
	* src/Makefile.am:  Truly ugly hack to make things work with 
	  automake 1.5.

Wed, 25 Jun 2003 16:17:37 -0700  Evan Martin  <martine@cs.washington.edu>

	Lots of console work.  Stripped executable is now 60k!
	* Makefile.am:  Don't build images on a console-only build.
	* configure.ac, getopt*:  Instead of autoconf'ing around the lack
	  of getopt_long, include glibc's version.  (This is pretty standard.)
	* gen/*:  Add some new command-line options, allow grouping options,
	  and combine the getopt code into one file.
	* configure.ac:  Remove _OBJ cruft left over from before we
	  switched automake.
	* src/Makefile.am:  Draft store and doc are now GTK-only.
	* conf.h, lj.c:  Remove no-longer-used options.
	* livejournal-entry.[ch]:  Combine some functions.
	* draftstore.c, logjam-doc.c:  Use those new functions.
	* init.c:  Better handling of options and of console mode.  Shorter
	  functions make code easier to read.  (Majority of changes are here.)
	* network-curl.c, network-gtk.c:  Fix dangling pointer.
	* sync.c:  Return success when there's nothing to sync.

Tue, 24 Jun 2003 16:19:00 -0700  Evan Martin  <martine@cs.washington.edu>

	We now support building --without-gtk.  From the command line you
	should be able to post, checkfriends, and sync the offline journal.
	This also forces better model-view separation.
	* a whole pile of files:  Add WITH_GTK conditionals.
	* util-gtk.c, network-gtk.c:  New files with the GTK-specific code.

Tue, 24 Jun 2003 14:50:16 -0700  Evan Martin  <martine@cs.washington.edu>

	We no longer build with XMMS, instead building a helper executable
	that links with XMMS.  This makes the logjam binary simpler.
	This will also allow binary packagers to make a "logjam-xmms" package.
	* configure.ac, src/Makefile.am:  Depend on automake >= 1.5,
	  allowing the Makefile to be much cleaner.  Optionally build
	  logjam-xmms-client when using XMMS.
	* init.c, meta.c:  Music-related simplifications.
	* music.c:  Use logjam-xmms-client instead of linking hackery.
	* music.h, settings.c:  Different error reporting for new system.

Sat, 21 Jun 2003 15:29:58 -0700  Evan Martin  <martine@cs.washington.edu>

	* livejournal.h, livejournal-entry.c, util.[ch]:
	  Let UTF-8 errors be reported back up to the user.
	* sync.c:  Show all warnings at the end of the sync.
	* history.c:  Use error-reporting function.
	* menu.c, protocol.c:  Warning fixes.
	* network.c:  Revert window trickery back to a simple dialog.
	  It was broken in too many ways.

Sat, 21 Jun 2003 09:51:54 -0700  Evan Martin  <martine@cs.washington.edu>

	* livejournal-entry.c:  Properly save custom allowmask.
	* journalstore.c:  Bump version number again.

Thu, 19 Jun 2003 18:47:26 -0700  Evan Martin  <martine@cs.washington.edu>

	* gen/opts.dat:  New command-line option to sync journal from
	  command line.  Useful on machines without X or from cronjobs.
	* init.c:  Parse new option.
	* sync.h:  Let sync operation return a boolean, so our exit
	  code in CLI mode can indicate whether the sync succeeded.
	* sync.c:  Vary feedback depending on whether we're in CLI mode.

Sun, 15 Jun 2003 14:29:19 -0700  Evan Martin  <martine@cs.washington.edu>

	* LogJam 4.2.1.

Sun, 15 Jun 2003 10:34:48 -0700  Evan Martin  <martine@cs.washington.edu>

	* network.h, protocol.[ch]:  Rearrangements.  Network results
	  now allocate a single string, instead of one string for each key
	  and value, so it's important for everyone else to use the proper
	  API for freeing requests and results as they now behave differently.
	* friendedit.c, friends.c, history.c:  Use proper network API.
	* network.c:  Renamed function.
	* journalstore.c:  Preallocate at least one spot in index for version.
	* util.[ch]:  Remove a few unneeded functions.

Sun, 15 Jun 2003 00:01:58 -0700  Evan Martin  <martine@cs.washington.edu>

	* journalstore.[ch], sync.c:  If we change the journal store format (as
	  we just did), detect it and invalidate the synced copy.
	* offline.c:  Cleaner code avoids as many weird hacks.

Fri, 13 Jun 2003 17:38:17 -0700  Gaal Yahas  <gaal@forum2.org>

	* he.po:  Hebrew updates.

Fri, 13 Jun 2003 11:18:09 -0700  Evan Martin  <martine@cs.washington.edu>

	* network.c:  Make progress window a popup (fixes fighting with the
	  window manager with WMs like ion).  (Please send me reports if this
	  works with/breaks on your WM.)

Sun, 08 Jun 2003 18:51:12 -0700  Evan Martin  <martine@cs.washington.edu>

	* he.po:  Update from Gaal.

Sun, 08 Jun 2003 18:29:03 -0700  Evan Martin  <martine@cs.washington.edu>

	* spawn.c:  phoenix is now "MozillaFirebird".

Sun, 08 Jun 2003 12:39:10 -0700  Evan Martin  <martine@cs.washington.edu>

	* lj.c:  Add undo/redo to right-click context menu (Ari).
	* livejournal-entry.c:  Load/save all entry fields when
	  loading/saving; this means we properly remember preformat but
	  you need to rexport your journal.
	* remote.c:  Remove unneeded header (fixes FreeBSD 4.8 build).

Fri, 06 Jun 2003 15:02:03 -0700  Evan Martin  <martine@cs.washington.edu>

	* logjam-doc.[ch], tools.c:  Let user specify encoding when inserting
	  files.  Better error reporting, too.

Wed, 04 Jun 2003 19:50:42 -0700  Evan Martin  <martine@cs.washington.edu>

	* 4.2.0 release.

Wed, 04 Jun 2003 19:46:03 -0700  Evan Martin  <martine@cs.washington.edu>

	* de.po: German update (Frank Hofmann).
	* ru_RU.po:  Russian update (Grigory Bakunov).
	* journalstore.c:  If removing an entry empties a day, remove the day.
	* livejournal-entry.c:  Silence invalid moodid warning.
	* offline.c:  Left-align "search" label and make enter run the search.
	* sync.c:  Fix progress math and stop console output.
	* util.c:  Set DST flag in time conversions.  (I found a mysterious
	  off-by-one-hour bug in my export; I hope this fixes it, because I
	  can't reproduce it... timezone bugs would put me off by more than
	  an hour.)

Sun, 01 Jun 2003 20:42:16 -0700  Evan Martin  <martine@cs.washington.edu>

	* smartquotes.c:  Avoid changing the entry whenever possible, so
	  loading an old entry doesn't immediately get flagged as modified.

Sun, 01 Jun 2003 20:14:26 -0700  Evan Martin  <martine@cs.washington.edu>

	* Makefile.am, smartquotes.[ch], tools.[ch], menu.c:
	  Smartquotes now operates as you type.
	* conf.h, conf_xml.c, settings.c:  Let user turn it on/off.
	* logjam-doc.[ch], lj.c:  Let doc know when the user changes, so
	  they don't accidentally save a post from the wrong journal over
	  a post in their current one.

Wed, 28 May 2003 13:07:14 -0700  Evan Martin  <martine@cs.washington.edu>

	* lj.h, menu.c:  Menu updates as suggested by Gaal.

Wed, 28 May 2003 09:22:10 -0700  Evan Martin  <martine@cs.washington.edu>

	* de.po:  Update from Frank Hofmann.

Wed, 28 May 2003 09:14:40 -0700  Evan Martin  <martine@cs.washington.edu>

	* conf_xml.c:  Compilation without GtkSpell was broken by the
	  spell language patch.  (George Mason)

Tue, 27 May 2003 10:26:39 -0700  Evan Martin  <martine@cs.washington.edu>

	* ru_RU.po:  Update from Grigory Bakunov <black@asplinux.ru>.

Mon, 26 May 2003 12:05:31 -0700  Evan Martin  <martine@cs.washington.edu>

	* journalstore.h:  Cleanup, ::get_count().
	* journalstore.c:  Better error reporting, off-by-one fix.
	* menu.c:  Use sync.h instead of declaring function directly.
	* network.[ch]:  Expose error-reporting functions.
	* offline.c:  Default to case-insensitive, inform user when loading
	  entries from empty journal, add title, show entries in the
	  selected day when we first pop up.
	* sync.c:  Cleanups; progress bar tweak so we can actually get to 100%.

Mon, 26 May 2003 04:12:18 -0700  Gaal Yahas  <gaal@forum2.org>

	* journalstore.[ch], offline.c: make "back" and "forward" buttons
	  work even when there is no current selection.

Mon, 26 May 2003 04:06:46 -0700  Evan Martin  <martine@cs.washington.edu>

	* conf.h, conf_xml.c, lj.c, settings.c:  Runtime selection of
	  spell-checking language.  (Kir Kolyshkin, lj user=bobuk)

Sat, 24 May 2003 12:58:25 -0700  Evan Martin  <martine@cs.washington.edu>

	* init.c, journalstore.c, livejournal-entry.c, lj_xml.c, offline.c
	  util.h:  Warning fixes.

Fri, 23 May 2003 22:44:42 -0700  Evan Martin  <martine@cs.washington.edu>

	* journalstore.c, offline.c:  Tiny memory leaks.  memprof reports
	  a bunch in GtkHTML, but that library appears to be in a lot of flux.

Fri, 23 May 2003 20:25:57 -0700  Evan Martin  <martine@cs.washington.edu>

	"...The problem is that security_cb makes a new Security struct on the
	stack, which is then uninitialized, but feeds sec.allowmask to
	custom_security_dlg_run. So instead of a blank mask or the existing
	one from the entry, you get whatever GCC's uninitialized-int garbage
	looks like when interpreted as a usemask by build_model..."
	Patch from Decklin Foster.
	* logjam-doc.[ch]:  get_security().
	* menu.c:  get before setting to new value.

Fri, 23 May 2003 16:29:23 -0700  Evan Martin  <martine@cs.washington.edu>

	Journal search.  The equality test is done via a callback, so
	if someone wanted to implement regular expressions it wouldn't
	be hard to pass the compiled RE object around.  (More difficult is
	figuring out the UI for it...)
	* journalstore.[ch]:  journal_store_search().
	* offline.c:  GUI for journal_store_search().

Fri, 23 May 2003 15:22:55 -0700  Evan Martin  <martine@cs.washington.edu>

	A pile of patches from George Mason, and one from Gaal.
	* journalstore.c:  Fix scope for older compilers. 
	* link.c:  glib 2.2 function.
	* livejournal-entry.c:  Crash on startup when loading entries.
	* network.c:  GTK 2.2 functions.
	* pollcreator.c:  #ifdef guards.
	* preview.h:  #ifdef out unless we have GtkHTML.

Thu, 22 May 2003 22:35:39 -0700  Evan Martin  <martine@cs.washington.edu>

	* journalstore.[ch], offline.c:  Show security icons in entry list.

Thu, 22 May 2003 19:38:00 -0700  Evan Martin  <martine@cs.washington.edu>

	Minor fixups.
	* offline.c:  Remove day titles from calendar to make it smaller.
	* preview.c:  Make clicking links actually show them in a browser.
	* tools.c:  Better smartquotes/XML attributes handling.  This still
	  won't work if a greater-than is included in an XML attribute, but
	  you should be using the entity reference in those cases anyway.

Wed, 21 May 2003 20:34:12 -0700  Evan Martin  <martine@cs.washington.edu>

	* Makefile.am, lj_xml.[ch]:  XML utility functions.
	* conf_xml.c, livejournal-types.c:  Use those functions.
	* util.c, util.h:  LiveJournal doesn't store seconds on posted
	  entries, but seconds do matter when syncing.  So we use full
	  times internally, but when we're showing entry dates we leave
	  off the redundant :00 at the end of every time.
	  XXX need to figure out how to sort entries that have the same
	  time; probably by itemid?  It doesn't matter so much as long
	  as we're internally consisten.
	* datesel.c, draftstore_ui.c:  Use noseconds version.
	* livejournal.h:  Entry from XML node.
	* offline.c:  Add simple warning.
	* journalstore.c:  The big change that all of the above was for:
	  We now store offline entries in a structure that includes the
	  month and year, as well as grouping entries within a day into
	  their own subnode.  This makes our code a lot easier, and makes
	  XSLT transformations a lot simpler.

Tue, 20 May 2003 01:55:24 -0700  Evan Martin  <martine@cs.washington.edu>

	* util.c:  Summary function (used in the list views) should never
	  return more than one line of text.

Tue, 20 May 2003 00:51:57 -0700  Evan Martin  <martine@cs.washington.edu>

	* journalstore.c:  Strip unneeded whitespace from journalstore XML
	  when loading it, so libxml can properly reformat it on output.
	* logjam-doc.c:  Extra print.

Sun, 18 May 2003 18:41:18 -0700  Evan Martin  <martine@cs.washington.edu>

	* tools.c:  Fix quotes balancing mistake introduced by a recent change.

Sat, 17 May 2003 22:45:23 -0700  Evan Martin  <martine@cs.washington.edu>

	Based on an idea from Gaal, we always keep the index in memory.
	This lets us move around based on date.
	* journalstore.c:  Use one file per month, GArray for index.
	  Date-relative searching ("next", "previous").
	* journalstore.h:  Provide time in subject summary, so entries
	  within a day can sort right.
	* network.c:  Minor cosmetic changes.
	* offline.c:  Date-relative movement ("next", "previous").
	* sync.c:  Reorganization to make the functions clearer.
	  More error messages (but still XXX, as all should be reported to
	  user via GUI, not console).
	* util.[ch], livejournal-entry.c:  Verify LJ server is giving us
	  UTF-8, because sometimes it doesn't.  This really needs to be fixed
	  server-side, but this works for now and it's sort of a good idea
	  to be safe anyway.

Sat, 17 May 2003 17:47:24 -0700  Evan Martin  <martine@cs.washington.edu>

	Update from Gaal.
	* Makefile.am, menu.c:  Factor out HTML preview.
	* conf.h, conf_xml.c:  Save offline journal window size.
	* journalstore.c:  Use subjects.
	* offlineui.c:  Better layout, HTML preview.
	* preview.c:  Show metadata in preview.

Thu, 15 May 2003 17:10:59 -0700  Evan Martin  <martine@cs.washington.edu>

	* configure.ac:  Depend on a newer librsvg.
	* logo-svg.h, network-throbber.c:  Use an array for static data
	  so we don't need to strlen().

Thu, 15 May 2003 00:22:12 -0700  Evan Martin  <martine@cs.washington.edu>

	Normally I don't commit halfway code, but this is getting too big.
	It pretty much works, but it needs a lot of polish and error checking.
	entrycache is gone because there wasn't enough shared functionality
	between drafts and (offline) journals.
	* Makefile.am:  remove entrycache*, add journalstore*, draftstore*,
	  offline.c, sync.c.
	* conf.[ch]:  slightly different method for getting conf path.
	* init.c:  silence compiler warning.
	* livejournal-entry.c, livejournal.h:  functions for retrieving
	  groups of entries from a network request and for serializing
	  a single entry to and from a DOM tree.
	* history.c:  reflect entry modifications.
	* draftstore*:  store for drafts.
	* lj.c, logjam-doc.c:  use draft store.
	* menu.c:  sync and offline menu items.
	* network*:  abstract network dialogs so sync can use an extended
	  dialog.
	* util.c:  modify time functions to include seconds.  (XXX?)

Wed, 14 May 2003 23:34:22 -0700  Evan Martin  <martine@cs.washington.edu>

	* lj.[ch], menu.c, undo-manager.[ch]:  Undo.  (Ari Pollak)

Wed, 14 May 2003 21:11:42 -0700  Evan Martin  <martine@cs.washington.edu>

	* tools.c:  An ugly hack lets HTML quotes go through, but only in
	  special cases (which happen to be 80% of the time).

Wed, 14 May 2003 16:42:21 -0700  Evan Martin  <martine@cs.washington.edu>

	* Makefile.am:  Rearrange so objects are together.
	* network.c:  Use a popup window, and keep over the main window.
	* util.c:  Set gravity (could this be what causes windows to
	  slowly creep when restoring geometry?).

Tue, 13 May 2003 18:27:29 -0700  Evan Martin  <martine@cs.washington.edu>
	
	Win32 fixes, mostly related to pulling out the dock code.

Sun, 11 May 2003 19:27:35 -0700  Evan Martin  <martine@cs.washington.edu>

	Throbber now conditionally supports SVG and rotation.
	* acinclude.m4:  Quote helpstring so it formats right.
	* configure.ac:  Show status of finding librsvg.
	* network.c, network-throbber.[ch]:  Split throbber out into its own
	  file, and add SVG code.
	* logo-svg.h:  Inline SVG logo.
	* src/Makefile.am:  Add new files.

Sun, 11 May 2003 18:59:37 -0700  Evan Martin  <martine@cs.washington.edu>

	* configure.ac, acinclude.m4: Simplify autoconf logic by pulling
	  module checks into their own function.
	* Makefile.am: PREVIEW->HTML, because other things will use the HTML
	  widget.

Sun, 11 May 2003 16:12:31 -0700  Evan Martin  <martine@cs.washington.edu>

	* tools.[ch]:  Use LogJamDoc instead of LJWin; "Smart Quotes".
	* menu.c:  Use new tools functions.
	* lj.[ch]:  lj_insert_file() no longer needed.
	Inspired by http://www.livejournal.com/users/evan/597928.html,
	but these smart quotes properly balance themselves when nested.

Sun, 11 May 2003 09:56:20 +0300  Gaal Yahas  <gaal@forum2.org>

	* link.c:  Guess if the selection is a URL. Prompted by a suggestion
	  made here: http://www.livejournal.com/community/logjam/57230.html

Sun, 11 May 2003 10:58:33 -0700  Evan Martin  <martine@cs.washington.edu>

	* network.c:  Remove extra -1 in post code.  Print request out
	  if debugging is on.
	* protocol.c:  Properly remove trailing character.

Thu,  8 May 2003 18:57:35 -0700  Evan Martin  <martine@cs.washington.edu>
	
	* livejournal-types.c:  Oops, we should return something.  (Gaal)
	* preview.c:  Oops, we should declare variables at the top.

Wed, 07 May 2003 22:42:04 -0700  Evan Martin  <martine@cs.washington.edu>

	You can now run "logjam -u foo" while LogJam is running to switch
	users in the running window.  (Requested by Brad.)
	* remote.[ch]:  Object/signal-ify remote control.  Support switching
	  users.
	* marshalers.*:  Add signal marshaler for remote command.
	* Makefile.am:  Add marshalers.*.
	* conf.h, settings.c, init.c, lj.c:  Use new remote API.

Tue, 06 May 2003 00:46:05 -0700  Evan Martin  <martine@cs.washington.edu>

	* lj.c:  Work around GtkSpell bug to keep spell checking even
	  when the document switches.  (Thanks:  George Mason, again.)

Sun, 04 May 2003 23:13:37 -0700  Evan Martin  <martine@cs.washington.edu>

	* lj.c:  When submitting/saving to a non-Unicode server,
	  refuse to submit non-ASCII.

Sun, 04 May 2003 22:54:20 -0700  Evan Martin  <martine@cs.washington.edu>

	Kill the "edit servers" dialog and use the manager throughout.
	* Makefile.am: remove login_server.c, add tie.[ch].
	* setting.c:  use "tie" API to simplify code.
	* conf.c, conf_xml.c, livejournal-types.c, livejournal.h, network.c,
	  protocol.[ch]:
	  Add protocolversion and default to protocol version 1.
	* manager.c: deleting, adding servers, and protocol version.
	TODO: delete should remove server from disk (and warn better),
	and delete should work on users (should we put a pointer to the server
	in the user structure?).

Fri, 02 May 2003 17:06:34 -0700  Evan Martin  <martine@cs.washington.edu>

	* friends.c:  It's legal to edit a friend that isn't in the
	  current view (if the user has filtered the view) and we shouldn't
	  die if that happens.  (Thanks to George Mason for finding this.)

Wed, 30 Apr 2003 17:43:59 -0700  Evan Martin  <martine@cs.washington.edu>

	* menu.c:  Don't assume pointers and ints are the same (thanks,
	  Debian Alpha buildd!).
	* history_recent.c:  Don't assume an entry is selected when the
	  user hits "ok".  (Shoan Motwani <shoan@net4india.com>)

Tue, 29 Apr 2003 12:21:47 -0700  Evan Martin  <martine@cs.washington.edu>

	* 4.1.2 release.

Fri, 25 Apr 2003 15:04:30 +0300  Gaal Yahas  <gaal@forum2.org>

	* console.c: Fix error tag.
	
	Draft fixes
	* entrycache_ui.c: ask for confirmation on delete.
	* lj.c, logjam-doc.[ch]: delete draft from disk.
	
	TODO: if while editing a draft the user deletes the current draft
	from the cache (via entrycache_ui), reset the current entry's itemid. 

Fri, 25 Apr 2003 01:57:24 -0700  Evan Martin  <martine@cs.washington.edu>

	* autogenerated files:  Add a "-n / --no-login" command line option.
	* lj.c, login.c:  Use "logjam -u test" to autologin as "test", and
	  "-u test --no-login" to get to test's journal directly.
	  Hacky, but the existing code was hacky, too.

Fri, 25 Apr 2003 01:24:58 -0700  Evan Martin  <martine@cs.washington.edu>

	* menu.c:  Change keyboad accelerators to avoid conflicts.
	  (http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=190595)

Sun, 20 Apr 2003 12:33:20 -0700  Evan Martin  <martine@cs.washington.edu>

	* util.[ch]:  Clean up geometry to allow saving paned window position;
	  function to summarize an entry in a UTF-8 safe way (useful for
	  the friends browser, too).
	* livejournal-entry.c:  Use summary function.
	* conf.h, conf_xml.c:  Support paned geometry.
	* friendgroups.c:  Use paned geometry.
	  
Sun, 20 Apr 2003 11:57:11 -0700  Evan Martin  <martine@cs.washington.edu>

	* logjam-doc.[ch]:  API for setting metadata.
	* menu.c, lj.c:  Use API to make metadata work right again.
	* network-curl.c:  Tag cURL errors so you can see it's not my
	  lame error messages.  ("socket error 111" when you connect to a
	  host that isn't up...)

Sun, 20 Apr 2003 11:31:09 -0700  Evan Martin  <martine@cs.washington.edu>

	* README, completion.pl, thanks.h, de.po:  German translation.
	  (Frank Hofmann <frankhofmann@gmx.ch>)

Sat, 19 Apr 2003 12:20:00 -0700  Evan Martin  <martine@cs.washington.edu>

	* about.c:  Link to homepage (requested by a user).

Fri, 18 Apr 2003 19:42:39 -0700  Evan Martin  <martine@cs.washington.edu>

	* TODO:  Link to poll in the LogJam community.
	* en_US.UTF-8.po:  English+Unicode translation (quotes, copyright).
	* configure.ac:  Make --without-gtkspell, etc. work.  Add translation.
	* gen/helptext.h.tmpl:  Let help message be translated (the way I had
	  it working before was before I really understood how gettext worked).
	* init.c:  Use new strings.

Fri, 18 Apr 2003 13:16:25 -0700  Evan Martin  <martine@cs.washington.edu>

	Document-based backend.  Doesn't fully work yet.
	* Makefile.am:  Add logjam-doc.[ch].
	* init.c:  Load documents from the command line.  (Still broken.)
	* link.c, preview.c:  Show how most functionality can interact
	  with the document and not the window.
	* livejournal.[ch]:  entry_new_from_stdin().
	* lj.c, menu.c:  Major restructuring, but a lot more clear.
	  Metadata (subjects, security, etc.) doesn't work yet.

Mon, 14 Apr 2003 21:01:21 -0700  Evan Martin  <martine@cs.washington.edu>

	* init.c, network-curl.c:  Use waitpid() to properly cleanup
	  child processes.
	* README:  Link to my page on X input for information about
	  typing em-dashes.

Sat, 12 Apr 2003 16:01:56 -0700  Evan Martin  <martine@cs.washington.edu>

	* 4.1.1 release.

Sat, 12 Apr 2003 15:59:55 -0700  Evan Martin  <martine@cs.washington.edu>

	* checkfriends.[ch]:  Cleanup API.  (Gaal)
	* preview.c:  Mark lj user tag non-UTF8 safe.
	* settings.c:  Make checkfriends-float option act immediately;
	  remove now-obselete code that takes place on dialog close.

Fri, 11 Apr 2003 14:22:12 -0700  Evan Martin  <martine@cs.washington.edu>

	* util.c:  Logic fix was all wrong (make mnemonics work again).

Thu, 10 Apr 2003 13:20:38 -0700  Evan Martin  <martine@cs.washington.edu>

	Checkfriends dock support. (Patch from Ari Pollak.)
	* Makefile.am:  Add EggTrayIcon.
	* checkfriends.[ch]:  Add dock.
	* conf.h, conf_xml.c:  Add dock; rename "auto" options.
	  (I kept backward compat for reading the 4.1.0 config file.)
	* settings.[ch]:  Add dock; keep checkfriends indicators in sync
	  with settings in prefs dialog; make checkfriends prefs menu
	  option zoom to checkfriends page (just reordered some lines, Gaal).

Thu, 10 Apr 2003 11:56:07 -0700  Evan Martin  <martine@cs.washington.edu>

	Make settings changes happen immediately.  Not all the way there yet.
	It's not only a good idea, it's in the HIG, and hopefully this will
	help make the checkfriends float/dock behavior make more sense to me.
	* settings.c:  Kill the entire saving procedure on close, and make
	  each widget affect its setting immediately.  This means:
	    - changing the font affects the LJ win font immediately
	    - changing the music setting and then picking "Diagnose"
	      diagnoses the new music setting (this one has been bothering
	      me for a while)
	  Also, preview the font in the setting window.
	* security.c:  Change the dialog from Cancel/OK to Close, in line
	  with the above goal.
	* util.c:  Minor logic fix.

Wed, 09 Apr 2003 22:59:56 -0700  Evan Martin  <martine@cs.washington.edu>

	Support lj user tag in HTML preview.  (Hacky!)
	* images/Makefile.am:  Install userinfo and community pngs into
	  system pixmap dir.  (And the LogJam goat and pencil, for fun.)
	* images/:  Rename logjam_userinfo->logjam_ljuser and
	  logjam_community->logjam_ljcomm.
	* src/Makefile.am:  Define pixmapdir so we can find it.
	* preview.c:  Parse lj user/lj comm tags and use system images.
	  Don't set the "utility" hint because it kills resizing on some
	  window managers.
	* friends.c, icons.c, link.c, manager.c, security.c:  We changed
	  the name of an image.

Wed, 09 Apr 2003 12:40:35 -0700  Evan Martin  <martine@cs.washington.edu>
	
	Win32 build works again.
	* README.win32:  Update docs-- no more cURL, gtk-wimp.
	* init.c, remote.c, settings.c, spawn.c:  Minor tweaks.

Tue, 08 Apr 2003 11:48:04 -0700  Evan Martin  <martine@cs.washington.edu>

	A big pile of small bugs.
	* friendedit.c:  Bring dialog up to LogJam standard (enter submits,
	  etc.)
	* friendgroupedit.c:  Spurious destroy caused warnings.
	* friends.c:  I don't understand how the old code ever worked.
	  Also, reenable the friend coloring because it seems the GTK bug
	  fixed itself.
	* history_recent.c:  Disable the "load more" button when you're at
	  the beginning of history.
	* init.c:  Fix segfault when loading file from the command line.
	  File loading is all messed up (because of the draft and save
	  changes) and needs to be fixed ASAP.
	* livejournal-entry.c:  Support init.c changes.
	* livejournal-types.c:  Compile warning.
	* manager.c:  Word-wrap labels so the dialog isn't huge.  Make the
	  dialog a bit taller by default.
	* meta.c:  Better reporting XMMS errors.
	
Mon, 07 Apr 2003 15:02:30 -0700  Evan Martin  <martine@cs.washington.edu>

	4.1.0 released.

Mon, 07 Apr 2003 14:47:14 -0700  Evan Martin  <martine@cs.washington.edu>

	http://www.livejournal.com/community/logjam/54182.html?thread=322214
	* history_recent.c:  Properly handle reaching the beginning
	  of history and empty history.
	* livejournal.h, livejournal-types.c:  Security saving API.
	* livejournal-entry.c, conf_xml.c:  Use security API.

Mon, 07 Apr 2003 13:30:54 -0700  Evan Martin  <martine@cs.washington.edu>

	* spawn.c:  Fix broken spawning by actually running the command
	  through /bin/sh, as promised in the settings dialog.  Also, use
	  a different spawning function to reduce quoting issues.

Sun, 06 Apr 2003 13:02:01 -0700  Evan Martin  <martine@cs.washington.edu>

	* menu.c:  Make cut/copy/paste paste to the focused widget, not
	  just the entry.  (Evolution has the same bug: put the cursor
	  in the "To" field on a new message, hit Ctl+V, and the text
	  appears in your message body.)

Mon, 31 Mar 2003 15:03:22 -0800  Evan Martin  <martine@cs.washington.edu>

	* po/completion.pl:  Update from Gaal to generate better HTML;
	  used to generate http://logjam.livejournal.com/translations .
	* po/es.po:  Update from Ricardo Mones.
	* src/settings.c, po/*.po:  Cut'n'paste typeo means I need to
	  regen pofiles again (but this doesn't break any strings).

Thu, 27 Mar 2003 22:48:10 -0800  Evan Martin  <martine@cs.washington.edu>

	Pretty near release, I think.
	* util.[ch]:  Change around the labelled_box_* functions.
	* login.c:  Use those functions (now has better resize behavior).
	* many files:  Use those changed functions.
	* menu.c:  Now that I understand how gettext works, I see that
	  we can leave many menu items untranslated and things will still
	  work.
	* thanks.pl:  Mark the list of people to thank as "not crucial"
	  for translation.
	* po/:  po update.

Thu, 27 Mar 2003 15:37:55 -0800  Evan Martin  <martine@cs.washington.edu>

	* init.c:  Save user accels across LogJam runs.  (From George
	  Mason <georgemason@mindspring.com>)
	* README:  Document how to make the accels work, even in GNOME. (me)

Thu, 27 Mar 2003 13:30:35 -0800  Evan Martin  <martine@cs.washington.edu>

	Manager work: servers.
	* conf.[ch]:  Rename server function that renames the directories
	  and reports errors.
	* login_server.c:  Use rename function when changing name.
	  (Note that this file will die when the manager has add/remove.)
	* manager.c:  Use rename function when changing name, and also
	  let user edit URL.
	* security.c:  Bump up size of custom security dialog (unrelated).

Thu, 27 Mar 2003 11:52:52 -0800  Evan Martin  <martine@cs.washington.edu>

	Make file saving work as you'd expect.  ("Save" saves the current
	entry to a draft/file, depending on whether it was loaded from a
	draft/file.)
	A huge pile of terrible hacks that make me feel dirty.  This will
	all be fixed by splitting into document-view, but that must wait
	until after the release.
	* livejournal-entry.c:  New API so we can tell what type we
	  autodetected a loaded file as.  Needed so we don't clobber
	  non-XML files when the user picks "Save".
	* entrycache.c:  Use new API.
	* lj.h:  Track the current filename and whether it was XML-based.
	* lj.c:  Track the current filename and keep the titlebar updated.
	  Make save work.
	* menu.c:  Update filename when loading entries.

Wed, 26 Mar 2003 15:25:37 -0800  Evan Martin  <martine@cs.washington.edu>

	Drafts improvements.  It's actually pretty usable now.
	* util.[ch]:  Buttonbox button from stock. (Delete button below.)
	* entrycache.c:  For header views, if a post has no date, use 
	  the mtime on the file.
	* entrycache_ui.c:  Improve draft loader (no crashes, better display).
	* lj.c:  Prompt for draft name when saving (defaulting to subject).

Tue, 25 Mar 2003 13:45:23 -0800  Evan Martin  <martine@cs.washington.edu>

	Code and UI cleanup.
	* pretty much every file:  Moved from using lj_dialog to gtk_dialog;
	  rearranged arguments to net_request_run(), tried to be more
	  HIG-compliant in spacing; made dialogs properly use the default
	  and allow escape to cancel.
	  There may be some bugs with the buttons controlling dialogs...

Tue, 25 Mar 2003 02:43:18 -0800  Evan Martin  <martine@cs.washington.edu>

	* README, link.c, menu.c, thanks.h, tools.[ch]:  lj-cut command.
	  (Based on patch from Dave Spadea <dave@spadea.net>.)
	* util.[ch]:  Infrastructure to simplify dialogs with sizegroups.
	* meta.c:  Use above.
	* link.c:  lj user/comm command, clean up lj link command.  Use
	  GtkDialog properly to make enter->ok and esc->cancel work as you'd
	  expect (I need to fix this up across the rest of the program).
	* tools.c:  Bring back "insert file".
	* preview.c:  Add note about lj-specific tags.
	* menu.c:  Rearrangements of menu items.

Mon, 24 Mar 2003 18:18:44 -0800  Evan Martin  <martine@cs.washington.edu>

	Remote command protocol allows us to have only one window open at a
	time.
	* remote.c, remote.h:  Remote commands via unix socket.  One command
	  currently implemented: "bring running instance to foreground".
	* src/Makefile.am:  Add new files to build.  (***This probably breaks
	  Win32***)
	* conf.h, conf_xml.c:  Add "allow multiple instances" option.
	* init.c, lj.c:  Use "allow multiple instances" option.
	* settings.c:  Let user change "allow multiple instances" option.

Mon, 24 Mar 2003 01:44:54 -0800  Evan Martin  <martine@cs.washington.edu>

	Minor cleanups abound!
	* console.c:  Bigger window by default.
	* menu.c:  Add "Edit" menu, with Cut/Copy/Paste.  Rearrangements.
	  Kill the accelerators on many menu items, as they only clutter
	  the menu and advanced users can set them themselves.
	* settings.c:  Spelling fix.
	* tools.c:  Use normal message dialogs-- there's no reason to
	  never show a dialog again when it only pops up when you've done
	  something wrong.  Remove "insert file" because it doesn't make sense
	  to have it.

Sun, 23 Mar 2003 23:50:07 -0800  Evan Martin  <martine@cs.washington.edu>

	HTML preview.
	* configure.ac, src/Makefile.am:  Conditionally compile in HTML
	  preview.
	* conf.h, conf_xml.c:  Save preview window geometry.
	* lj.h:  Track preview so only one is visible at a time; expose
	  read_entry API for preview to retrieve from.
	* menu.c:  Conditionally show "Preview HTML" in Tools menu.
	* preview.c:  The preview code.

Wed, 19 Mar 2003 18:34:40 -0800  Evan Martin  <martine@cs.washington.edu>

	* Makefile.am, lj.c:  Killed structuredtext (put off until it actually
	  works right).
	* friendgroups.c, security.c:  Killed warnings about friend groups.
	* manager.c:  Restructuring to make layout better.  Make checkboxes
	  actually change the settings they reflect.
	* settings.c:  Music gets its own tab.

Tue, 18 Mar 2003 17:59:15 +0200  Gaal Yahas  <gaal@forum2.org>
	
	Resurrected manger; per-user checkfriends mask.
	* src/manager.c, src/Makefile.am, src/menu.c: make manager
	  available.
	* src/checkfriends.[ch], src/security.[ch], src/settings.[ch],
	  src/lj.c, src/conf.h, src/conf_xml.c, src/init.c, src/util.[ch],
	  src/xml_macros.h, src/livejournal.h: per-user checkfriends mask.
	* src/groupedbox.[ch], src/foldbox.[ch]: folding grouped box widget.

	i18n stuff.
	* po/logjam.pot, po/he.po: Hebrew translation updates.
	
Mon, 10 Mar 2003 17:51:13 -0800  Evan Martin  <martine@cs.washington.edu>

	New network code.  Works on Win32 and is much cleaner than before.
	* configure.ac:  Pull in gthread on win32 and leave out Curl; set
	  a flag for which network subsystem we're using.
	* src/Makefile.am:  Use above flag to build proper network code.
	* init.c:  Initialize threads on win32.  Don't crash when
	  checkfriends'ing from the command line and they didn't provide a
	  user.
	* network.[ch], network-win32.c, network-curl.c, network-internal.h:
	  New network code.  Much better than before (hopefully).

	With this new network code, we no longer need a "System" settings
	tab on Win32; all of that information is provided by the OS.
	(Music may have to come back in the future.)
	* conf.h, conf_xml.c, music.[ch], settings.c:  Add new music detection
	  type "none" for Windows platforms; only use music and proxy settings
	  on non-Windows builds.

	Misc fixes while building on Win32:
	* livejournal-entry.c:  Macro pasting fix (Thanks, Decklin).
	* usejournal.c:  const fix.
	* util.c:  const fix; possibly ancient bug fix(?).
	* util.h:  Get string.h here, so we don't need it everywhere.  And
	  we don't use GtkClist anymore.
	* checkfriends.c, entrycache.c, lj.c:  Fix warning for unlink().
	* friends.c:  Old bug that would cause crashes when cancelling friends
	  loads.

Fri, 07 Mar 2003 02:17:10 -0800  Evan Martin  <martine@cs.washington.edu>

	* conf.h, conf_xml.c, lj.c, lj.h, login.c, login.h, menu.c,
	  settings.c:  Remove crufty settings that aren't useful.  (I
	  think the "keep metadata" one didn't even work?  And nobody
	  noticed?  That's how useless it was.)

Fri, 28 Feb 2003 18:37:14 -0800  Evan Martin  <martine@cs.washington.edu>

	* init.c, lj.c, meta.[ch]:  Revert previous change (music autodetect).
	* meta.c:  Move labels to be more HIG-like.
	* structuredtext.c:  Minor changes to make multilevel lists work.

Sun, 23 Feb 2003 02:00:44 -0800  Evan Martin  <martine@cs.washington.edu>

	* init.c, lj.c, meta.[ch]:  Autodetect music by default.

Sun, 23 Feb 2003 01:21:22 -0800  Evan Martin  <martine@cs.washington.edu>

	* music.[ch]:  Allow user to specify a music-detection command.
	* conf.h, conf_xml.c:  Save and restore preference.
	* settings.c:  GUI to set preference, which means the detection mode
	  can change at runtime, which means we need...
	* meta.[ch]:  New code to let the Detect button show and hide,
	  depending on the music settings.
	* init.c:  If they didn't compile with XMMS support, default
	  the music source to the command (even if one wasn't specified).

Sat, 22 Feb 2003 23:07:50 -0800  Evan Martin  <martine@cs.washington.edu>

	* init.c:  Use of SIG_IGN with SIGCHLD has special meaning and
	  undefined semantics by POSIX which can lead to unexpected getting an
	  unexpected ECHILD when later waiting on a child process.  This
	  becomes more apparent in a recent 2.5.x kernel with more
	  standards-compliant signal handling and NPTL. [Jeremy Katz]

Sat, 22 Feb 2003 18:58:48 -0800  Evan Martin  <martine@cs.washington.edu>

	* groupedbox.[ch]:  GNOME HIG-specified grouping widget 
	  (prompted by Gaal).
	* settings.c:  Use GroupedBox and other HIG guidelines.  I haven't
	  touched Check Friends, as Gaal has Plans for that.  Fold "Web
	  Browser" and "Proxy" into "System" tab (the whole tab should
	  be unnecessary on Win32).
	* TODO:  Accelerator problem is simplified due to HIG.

Sat, 22 Feb 2003 13:19:21 -0800  Evan Martin  <martine@cs.washington.edu>
	
	* login.c, conf_xml.c: Work around LiveJournal mood bug.

Sat, 15 Feb 2003 13:36:23 -0800  Evan Martin  <martine@cs.washington.edu>

	* configure.ac:  Detect mingw when building and set -mms-bitfields so
	  we link ok on Windows.  Also remove old cruft.
	* network.c:  Old cruft.
	* src/Makefile.am:  Set AM_CFLAGS to avoid a warning.

Sat, 15 Feb 2003 12:58:18 -0800  Evan Martin  <martine@cs.washington.edu>

	* init.c:  Use bind_textdomain_codeset() to force UTF-8 in
	  non-UTF-8 locales.
	* README.win32:  Notes on building with mingw.

Thu, 13 Feb 2003 18:24:08 -0800  Evan Martin  <martine@cs.washington.edu>

	* login.c:  Sometimes LJ is sending us malformed mood lists, but we
	  they're not malformed enough to be beyond working around.
	* menu.c:  Typeo was making picture keywords not work.
	* meta.c:  We're using NULL to indicate no text, not "".

Wed, 12 Feb 2003 21:35:37 -0800  Evan Martin  <martine@cs.washington.edu>

	* datesel.c:  In Right-to-Left languages, we still want the hour selector
	  to the left of the minute selector.
	  Also, minutes should always be displayed in double digits.  (I had to
	  read the GTK source to figure that one out...)

Wed, 12 Feb 2003 20:15:23 -0800  Evan Martin  <martine@cs.washington.edu>

	* login.c:  Allow user to bypass login by shift-clicking Login button.
	  This is documented, but not obvious, in hopes that anyone who takes the
	  effort to find it will read enough to understand why logging
	  in usually isn't necessary.
	* README:  Documentation.
	* conf_xml.c:  Cache usejournals, so you still have your list of
	  communities when you bypass logging in.
	* meta.c:  Attach error window to the window when detecting music.
	  (*grumbles something about UTF-8 locale and ISO-8859-1 ID3 tags*)

Wed, 12 Feb 2003 19:36:19 -0800  Evan Martin  <martine@cs.washington.edu>
	
	* po/he.po:  Hebrew updates (Gaal).
	* src/lj.c, src/login.c, src/network.c, po/logjam.pot:  Some
	  more translatable strings.

Tue, 11 Feb 2003 19:02:19 -0800  Evan Martin  <martine@cs.washington.edu>
	
	* po/: Ukranian translation (Dmitry Dyomin).
	  Update pofiles.  Hebrew update (Gaal Yahas).
	* po/valmenu.pl:  Tool to validate po files (Gaal).
	* src/: Clean up translation strings, and use translated menu items.

Sun, 09 Feb 2003 15:54:15 -0800  Evan Martin  <martine@cs.washington.edu>

	* many files:  Merged entrycache work, which involved a restructuring
	  of the configuration files and many other changes.  Still in progress.
	  The configuration file format has changed in a non-backwards-compatible
	  manner.

Sun, 09 Feb 2003 15:34:40 -0800  Evan Martin  <martine@cs.washington.edu>

	* configure.ac, po/es.po, README: Spanish translation.  (Thanks Ricardo
	  Mones Lastra.) 
	* src/settings.c:  Mark translatable strings.
	* po/*:  Update pofiles for translators.

Fri,  7 Feb 2003 21:53:45 -0800  Evan Martin  <martine@cs.washington.edu>

	* conf.h, conf_xml.c, entrycache.c, init.c, settings.c, spawn.c,
	  util.c, MAkefile.msc:  Windows fixes and we now use the
	  Windows-configured browser instead of configuring it ourselves.

Sat, 25 Jan 2003 16:59:35 -0800  Evan Martin  <martine@cs.washington.edu>

	* lj.c:  Don't autologin if the current user doesn't have a password.
	  (Reported by HJ.)

Sat, 18 Jan 2003 16:24:15 -0800  Evan Martin  <martine@cs.washington.edu>
	
	* checkfriends.c:  Set window name and class on the floating
	  indicator.
	* configure.ac, music.c:  Use gmodule instead of dlopen for
	  portability  (Gaal).  (Strangely needs gthread, too, to not lock?)
	* settings.c, music.c:  Let user be told why music detection is
	  failing.

Tue, 31 Dec 2002 00:11:55 -0800  Evan Martin  <martine@cs.washington.edu>

	* music.c:  Convert text returned from music detection to UTF-8.

Fri, 13 Dec 2002 00:57:19 -0800  Evan Martin  <martine@cs.washington.edu>

	* lj.[ch], structuredtext.c, README.structuredtext, Makefiles:
	  Beginnings of structured text.  Needs work, of course.
	* util.[ch]:  Allow "ERROR" message windows.

Sat, 07 Dec 2002 17:48:27 -0800  Evan Martin  <martine@cs.washington.edu>

	* tools.[ch], menu.c:  XML validation tool.

Wed, 04 Dec 2002 10:31:20 -0800  Evan Martin  <martine@cs.washington.edu>

	  from the 26th because they were overkill.

Tue, 26 Nov 2002 12:06:29 -0800  Evan Martin  <martine@cs.washington.edu>
	
	* datesel.[ch], meta.c:  Better date picker.  (Still need to add a
	  time picker to it.)
	* ljtypes.[ch]: Better internal date management.

Tue, 26 Nov 2002 01:37:53 -0800  Evan Martin  <martine@cs.washington.edu>

	  selection of servers at login time.

	* menu.[ch], tools.[ch]:  Pull "tools" into their own file.
	* meta.c, ljtypes.c:  When saving an entry, save the time along
	  with it (unless the "Now" option is checked).

	* meta.c, music.[ch]: Pull music detection code into its own file

	* debian/*: Add Debian packaging information to CVS.

Sun, 10 Nov 2002 00:26:00 -0800  Evan Martin  <martine@cs.washington.edu>

	* spawn.c: Add phoenix to the predefined list of web browsers.
	  Correctly show an error message if the browser doesn't load.
	* spawn.h, friends.c, menu.c, checkfriends.c: Showing error message
