Most importantly, here's a list of what the users want:
http://www.livejournal.com/community/logjam/49865.html

But for those looking for smaller projects, we have this file.


Small projects
--------------

Make sure the accelerators work and are consistent throughout the entire
application.

egrep 'XXX|FIXME' *.[ch]
Either fix the problems, or verify they aren't really problems and
remove the XXX/FIXME from the file.


Medium projects
---------------

Make sure everything is GNOME HIG compliant:
http://developer.gnome.org/projects/gup/hig/1.0/
This mostly means verifying we got the spacing right on dialogs
everywhere, but it can include behavioral modifications.
(The poll creator especially could use some love here.)

Use a model to filter the friends view instead of rebuilding the list
when we filter.

(Evan is currently working on an alternate list model.)

Friends tracking. (Evan is working on this.)

Clean up checkfriends.  (Gaal)

Poll Creator revamp.  (Evan)

Improve the usability design of the “Servers and Users” dialog (what
used to be called the User Manager; manager.c). I think a better design
would be to make it paned so that the prefs section is always visible.
Or was it like that already?  (Gaal)

Testing!

Insert output of an external command. An initial patch for this exists
but it blocks the GUI. (lj users={k001, paracloud} to work on this).

Large projects
--------------

Multiple windows/tabs (most of the structure is already in place, but
there are some weird subtleties about settings-- should a settings
change affect all windows, or just the window that the settings dialog
was pulled up on?).  (Gaal is working on this.)

Gaal: Backup of other journals. I think we should be able to do this, if not
in batch mode for whole journals, then at least incrementally for
current entries. See "Friends" below.

Allow embedding VIM as the editing widget.
It might require GNOME:
http://www.opensky.ca/gnome-vim/

Gaal: Comments manager. This will need server/protocol support but I'm
counting on your influence on Brad and mine on Anatoly.

Gaal: Make your friends view accessible to LogJam. I like LogJam's feel
more than I like my browser's. Especially that of talkread.bml. :) Also,
GtkTextView does almost all the important stuff needed for basic
rendering: <i>, <b>, <u>, and so on. It can embed pictures, for elk's
sake! And, of course, LogJam can work offline. A GtkTreeView can
represent a post and its comments, and there will be great rejoice.
(Evan is currently working on this.)

Poll Editor: the idea is to allow changing a poll while it's not yet
been submitted to the server. This will require (a) parsing the poll
markup and (b) interfacing with the poll creator to populate it. We
might punt on the parser and use bison, which with some care will only
be necessary in maitainer mode. (Gaal; bluesky)
