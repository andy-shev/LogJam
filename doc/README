Introduction
------------
"LiveJournal.com... because you like to think other people care."
LogJam is a client for LiveJournal.  It lets you post, edit old
entries, manage your friends, and whatever other useful
LiveJournal-related features we can think of.

Visit http://logjam.danga.com for the latest version and up-to-date
information about LogJam development.


Requirements
------------
LogJam requires GTK+ 2.0 or greater.  
Get GTK+ at http://www.gtk.org.

LogJam also requires libcurl, an HTTP library.

Debian users need libgtk2.0-dev, libxml2-dev, libcurl-dev, and their
dependencies.

RPMs of libcurl are linked from the LogJam page.


Enhancements
------------
None of these enhancements are required to build LogJam.
LogJam should detect whether you have them at configure-time and
conditionally enable them.

 - Spell checking support requires GtkSpell 2.0.2 or later.
   For more information about GtkSpell, visit http://gtkspell.sf.net.

 - Current music autodetection requires XMMS 1.2 or later.
   Visit http://www.xmms.org.

 - HTML preview requires libGtkHTML 3.  This is the HTML widget used by
   Ximian's evolution, so it shouldn't be hard to find.

Debian users can apt-get libgtkspell-dev, xmms-dev, libgtkhtml3-dev, and
their dependencies.


Getting Started
---------------
You need a LiveJournal account to use LogJam.
LogJam cannot create this.  Visit http://www.livejournal.com to get
an account.

(LogJam can also be used with alternative LiveJournal sites, though
you'll have to find them yourself.)

LogJam has a pretty standard setup.
Running:
	$ ./configure 
	$ make
	$ su
	# make install
should be all you need to install it.

The installed executable is called "logjam".


Using LogJam
------------
Most of LogJam should be self-explanatory.  That's why you're using a
GUI, right?

GTK Accelerators:
You can remap the accelerators for any menu item.  To do it, first
enable the accelerator-changing functionality in GTK by appending this
line to ~/.gtkrc-2.0:
  gtk-can-change-accels = 1
or, on a GNOME system, with this command:
  gconftool-2 -s /desktop/gnome/interface/can_change_accels -t bool true
Then open up a menu in LogJam, move the mouse over a menu item, and type
a keystroke to bind that menu item to that keystroke.  (To clear an
accelerator, hit backspace.)

Unicode characters:
LiveJournal, LogJam, and GTK2 all support unicode, so LogJam is capable of
posting in almost any language you can find.  Additionally, many
characters that are not part of the ASCII standard (such as an em-dash)
are available.  Please visit my page on X input:
  http://neugierig.org/content/input/
for details on configuring this.


Also:
If there is anything you don't like about LogJam, don't just complain
about it in your LiveJournal, tell me!  I can't fix it if I don't know
about it.
